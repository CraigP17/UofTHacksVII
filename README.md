# UofTHacksVII - RecipeReady

Do you like cooking? How much time do you spend cooking a day? Is that how much time you *really* want to spend cooking? RecipeReady is the app for you. As students who are constantly busy, the last thing we want to do is spend hours on cooking. We created RecipeReady, to streamline the process of finding quick recipes within your time constraints.

This Android application was our project for the UofTHacks VII 36-hour hackathon on January 17-19, 2020. With RecipeReady, you can simply say "I have __30__ minutes, and I want to have __Lunch__. I'm craving __Anything!__" and RecipeReady will provide you with recipes for "__Anything__ Under __30__ minutes".

Further, you can select your favourite recipes to be saved so you can easily access them. But it does't stop there. Your favourites list can be turned into a Shopping List with all the ingredients accumulated so you do not need to spend time trying to remember what ingredients you need and how much to buy.

## Overview of App

#### RecipeReady consists of:
  * **Search Page:** Simple UI to find any recipes
    * **Time Search:** Finding recipes to fit however much time you have available to cook. It can also be filtered by time of day (Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner) and the type of cuisine.
    * **Quick Search:** Finding recipes when you know exactly what you want to eat as well as access to the full list of recipes
    * **Nutrition Search:** Finding recipes based on nutritional values such as calories, protein, fats, carbs, etc. *(In Progress)*
  * **Favourites:** Users can star their favourite recipes which are then easily accessible and displayed on this page
  * **Recommended:** Using the user's past searches and favourite recipes, it can suggest other recipes for the user
  * **Shopping Cart:** Utilizing the user's favourite recipes, a shopping list is made, that accumulates the ingredients of the user's favourite recipes, providing the user with a simple list of groceries needed to make their favourite foods.
  * **Nutrition:** Takes the user's past recipes and accumulates the food's nutritional values and calories, providing the user with clear details of their past meals. *(In Progress)*

## Future of RecipeReady

Due to time constraints of the hackathon, we prioritized the overall completion of the app over some features. We plan on continuing the work on the app, to develop and finish more features, as well as potentially release it on the Google Play store.
